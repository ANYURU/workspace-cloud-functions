A cloud function to handle user at creation.

## ü§ñ Documentation

The cloud function is designed to perform specific tasks upon the creation of a new user in the system. It carries out the following actions:

1. Creation of a New Document: It creates a new document within the users collection, representing the newly registered user. This document will contain the relevant user information such as name, email, and other necessary details.

2. Assignment of Free Package: Upon creating the user document, the function automatically assigns a free package to the newly registered user. The details of the free package, such as its features and limitations, will be included in the user document.

3. Addition of the user to the system team: It adds the user to the system team. If the user is the first to be added as a member or an administrator.

By executing these tasks, the cloud function seamlessly handles the registration process for new users, creating user documents, assigning the appropriate package as well as the right roles both at system team level and document level in the users collection system.
